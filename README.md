Report
I gained knowledge of how to use Python, OpenCV and Matplotlib to carry out simple arithmetic operations on images in this lab. I noticed that adding values makes an image brighter by raising pixel intensities, whereas subtracting values makes it darker by lowering pixel intensities. Both brightness and contrast are increased by multiplication by factors larger than one, while they are decreased by multiplication by factors smaller than one. Division has the opposite effect of multiplication; when a number is divided by more than one, the image becomes darker. Additionally, I learned how to alter specific color channels, like lowering just the red channel to produce a cyan tint. In digital image processing, these basic operations are crucial for tasks like color correction, contrast enhancement, and brightness adjustment.
